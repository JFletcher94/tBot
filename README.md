Find the twitter bot in action at: http://www.twitter.com/EGilmoreSocial

This software uses tweepy to interact with twitter, which can be found here: 
https://github.com/tweepy/tweepy.github.com

the file egilmoret.py, that tweets the string generated by egilmoreb.py is not included in the repository. It is identical to examplet.py except for importing egilmoreb instead of exampleb, and using real access keys/tokens.
